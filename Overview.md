# Overview

## Mysteries for the party to solve

- What is [the Gliss](World/Gliss.md)?
- How do they get home?
  - How did they get to [Poseidon](World/Poseidon.md)?
  - Where are Poseidon and [Hestia](World/Hestia.md) in relation to each other?
- What's up with Poseidon's sun?

## Planned arc

1. Land on Poseidon ([Session Zero](Sessions/Session0.md) or [1](Sessions/Session1.md))
2. Get acquainted with Poseidon
3. Discover that Hestia is "below" Poseidon
4. Venture into and through [the Underdark](World/Underdark.md)
5. Return to Hestia

## Questions and thoughts

- How can they discover how Hestia and Poseidon relate?
  - Probably a number of ways, this is the main physics puzzle
- How do the Overworld and Underdark relate?
  - Consequentially, how could the party interface with them in order to get back to Hestia?
- What's the thematic importance of the existence of the Gliss, Poseidon's sun, and the equi-magic-potential surface?
  - Maybe it's just a physics discovery, and that holds intrinsic importance from the perspective of the characters and players

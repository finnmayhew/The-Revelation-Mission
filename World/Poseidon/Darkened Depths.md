# The Darkened Depths

The lowest realm of [Poseidon](../Poseidon.md).

It's a dark green murky area that is unbreathable by Marids, and separated from the rest of the ocean by a film that itself looks like a surface of water. Ships avoid the area for its low visibility and abundance of monsters.

The Darkened Depths is where Poseidon's monsters live. The Weave is less powerful here, so monsters are capable of possessing magic (though it's still rare).

Descending as far down as the Darkened Depths go leads to the [Underdark](../Underdark.md).

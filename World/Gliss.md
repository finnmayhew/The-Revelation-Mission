# The Gliss

The Gliss and Poseidon's "sun" are two sides of the same object (which I'll call the Gliss), and you can pass "into" the Gliss and come "out of" Poseidon's sun, like a black whole and a white hole. Poseidon's sun acts as a source of the Weave and the Gliss acts as a sink of the Weave. The Weave is a vector field similar to the electromagnetic field that imparts a force onto objects, and its corresponding scalar potential is a "magic potential" (maybe the party will name this something else). The Gliss and Poseidon's sun are situated such that they act as a magic charge / image charge pair that create an equi-magic-potential surface at the surface of [Hestia](./Hestia.md) and [Poseidon](./Poseidon.md). Poseidon's sun is not at the center of the whole structure (otherwise the Gliss would be at infinity to be the image of Poseidon's sun). When Poseidon's sun moves for whatever reason, the Gliss moves to be its image and preserve the equi-magic-potential surface.

TO DO:

- What does the equi-magic-potential surface acheive?

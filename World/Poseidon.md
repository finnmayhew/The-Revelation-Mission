# Poseidon

[Hestia](./Hestia.md) and Poseidon are the exterior and interior surfaces (respectively) of a spherical shell.

Poseidon is a world entirely made of water. It's not that it's a water world with no islands, it's that there is no surface to the water — when you swim up, there is a force that increases in strength that pushes you back down.

## Physics effects

There are two forces on anyone in Poseidon, gravity and the magic force. Consider a frame where you're standing on the surface of Poseidon, where Hestia is below you and the sun is above.

Gravity points upwards. It decreases linearly with height. The boundary conditions are Hestia's true gravity at the boundary between the worlds and close to 0 at the sun.

The magic force points downwards. Its magnitude increases approximately quadratically with height (not actually quadratically because of the difference in magic charge between the sun and the Gliss — but approaches quadratic closer and closer to the sun).

There is a considerable layer of mantle between Hestia and Poseidon's surface, and the Gliss and sun are set up such that the equi-magic-potential is at Hestia's surface, not Poseidon's. Therefore Hestia's surface is where the magic force is at its weakest, and it's stronger at Poseidon's surface. Similarly, gravity is weaker at Poseidon's surface (due to the linear dropoff), and strongest at Hestia's.

## The Overworld

(inspired by [this video](https://youtu.be/ksAu3OHMZzo) and [this video](https://youtu.be/5U-PYEMReI0))

- The Gliss / Poseidon's sun is a "Plane of Water vortex"
  - Mostly useful for me
- The "Darkened Depths" (Plane of Ooze / Swamp of Oblivion) before the Underdark
  - This is a place the marids cannot go, but the elementals can — so the revelers may have to be guided by elementals
- Towards the Plane of (Ice, Salt, Steam), water becomes (cold, brackish, hot)
- The "Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls" ("Citadel" for short) is the colony (coral citystate) the revelers find
  - Designed around a series of natural currents
  - Several dozen miles wide
  - Domed, curved buildings (more like shells than domes)
  - Big glowing pearls light the city
- People: Marids, "elementals" (water elementals) (what about sahuagin, triton, merfolk, and locathah? — maybe those are from Hestia)
  - Marids and elementals live almost parallel to each other
    - "Istishia" is the leader of the elementals (maybe scrap?)
  - They are fundamentally very different, and do not share a language or most biological needs
  - Most of what the party interfaces with will be the Marid part of the colony
- Creatures/monsters: Mephits (ice and steam, closer to respective planes), "safarat" (sea hags), aboleths
  - Mephits are very rare near the Citadel, not a big deal
  - Safarat are dangerous because they disguise themselves as marids and sneak into the Citadel and then attack people
    - Unknown what they want or how intelligent they are
  - Aboleths are very rare, like dragons
    - Not mythical, but most marids have never seen one
  - General big fish also exist, closer to the Darkened Depths (which has less gravity)
- "red tides" are currents that carry parasites
- "burn water" are acidic patches of water
- Plenty of names to draw from, the gods of the plane

TODO: What do the elementals want?

## The Underdark

The solid mantle between Hestia's and Poseidon's surfaces is the Underdark.

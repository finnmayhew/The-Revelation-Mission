# Secret Backstory

Maridian life originated in the [Darkened Depths](./World/Poseidon/Darkened_Depths.md) thousands of years ago. At that point in history, some Marids (like the monsters who live in the Darkened Depths) had magic. A very powerful magic user named [Kalbari](./NPCs/Kalbari.md) captured a [Shabah](./NPCs/Shabah.md) and used it as her phylactery to gain nature powers, and set to rule the Marids.

(Originally, Kalbari and her Shabah were friends. That ended when she used it as her phylactery.)

After discovering through her powers the coral colony that would become the [Citadel](./World/Poseidon/Citadel.md), and [Hestian](./World/Hestia.md) life, she established herself at the center of a palace in the interior of the Citadel. She gathered the other Marids to the Citadel to start life there with her as the ruler, now that the Marids were born without magic, and she used her lich powers to throw around the [Gliss](./World/Gliss.md), with the knowledge that it would prevent people from being born with magic on Hestia due to a lack of a low-level equi-magic-potential surface there, preventing them from coming to Poseidon and surpassing her power.

However, whether out of kindness or out of hope to eventually get their friend back, the Shabah fought back by moving the Gliss on the [Poseidon](./World/Poseidon.md) side to restore and maintain the equi-magic-potential surface, outside of the knowledge of Kalbari. This is why Hestians are born with magic now.

To prevent the Shabah from breaching the interior of the Citadel, using a magic item she created called the Stormrider's Pearl, Kalbari set up the Currents and the Wakes, which disrupt Shabah life similarly to how they disrupt Maridian life.

In the 5000's of Hali, a Shabah finally breached the Citadel. It didn't manage to take the captured Shabah, but it did take the Stormrider's Pearl, but the Pearl was lost before it could be destroyed, and soon it floated back up from the Darkened Depths, where it was taken back into Kalbari's control. This is how the Pearl came into public knowledge.

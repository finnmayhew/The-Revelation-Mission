# Session 1

## Prep

Things that should happen:

- Learn that the ship is damaged (in what way?)
- Find the Citadel and seek refuge there
- Maybe meet up with the NPC who has been working on communication with the Shabah, and they can give the PCs something that allows them to communicate with the Marids

### Pre-session with Brandon

Lux wakes up before everyone else. They put on a spacesuit, then take the other four, tie them out in front of the viewscreen with Mu's rope. They head to the coral colony.

Their intention is "to find a way to not die over there."

I told Brandon that there was intelligent life there, he said Lux would try to communicate, and find food.

What I'll do is have it be that the party (probably) does not run into Lux, and finagle what Lux does to make that true after the fact (between sessions 1 and 2).

### 1. Fallout from the crash

### 2. Introduction to Poseidon

# Session 1

## Prep

Things that should happen:

- Learn that the ship is damaged (in what way?)
- Find the Citadel and seek refuge there
- Maybe meet up with the NPC who has been working on communication with the Shabah, and they can give the PCs something that allows them to communicate with the Marids

# Session 1

## Prep

### 0. Pre-session with Brandon

Lux wakes up before everyone else. They put on a spacesuit, then take the other four, tie them out in front of the viewscreen with Mu's rope. They head to the coral colony.

Their intention is "to find a way to not die over there."

I told Brandon that there was intelligent life there, he said Lux would try to communicate, and find food.

What I'll do is have it be that the party (probably) does not run into Lux, and finagle what Lux does to make that true after the fact (between sessions 1 and 2).

### 1. Fallout from the crash

After some amount of time, the crew wakes up uninjured (the canonical justification for this is that the Shabah cradled the Revelation as it fell so that they wouldn't take more damage than being knocked out). Outside the viewscreen, they see just water, with rays of light coming from above. The ship seems to be neutrally buoyant.

Lux is gone, and five spacesuits hang outside the viewscreen, tethered to the ship with Mu's rope.

Captain Sarnos may have to present a case that he's the real Sarnos.

Norvin is awake again, although it feels a low, constant buzz of energy, which it can tune out after a few minutes, though it remains present.

The ship is also miraculously intact. The liftoff system is damaged — upon investigation, there was a small hull breech that ruptured the fuel tank, and the fuel bled out into the ocean (the fuel is kerosene, which could be recovered from petroleum in passing rocks in the future). Thrusters still work, and the gas that they release is created by solar power, so they will be able to work indefinitely as long as the ship can see the sun. The sending stones are undamaged.

Ground control will say that the Revelation is no longer visible and will ask for their status. In general, they'll be pretty much in the dark. They'll let the crew know when the Gliss flies around or away.

### 2. First contact

At some point, they hear a tapping at the viewscreen. But it looks like nothing is out there. On a `DC 20 Perception Check`, they'll notice that there's a distortion in the water right in front of the viewscreen, which quickly zips away (a Shabah).

A few minutes later, they see something in front of the viewscreen. It's a fish-like person ([Aicha](../NPCs/Laminites/Aicha.md)), even more fish-like than the Tritons (for instance, she has fins and tails instead of hands and feet). She's wearing flowy green clothes. As soon as she sees them see her, she starts and swims upwards, out of sight.

Moments later, a dark grey submarine (the Itisal) enters the viewscreen, about the same size as the Revelation. It has a design Norvin and Sarnos don't recognize — its hull is curved in an an asymmetric spiral — but the curves have a gap in the same place as the Revelation's viewscreen, and the crew can see another crew of fish-people on the bridge of this other ship.

Thinking the Revelation crew are some strangely advanced monsters, the Itisal will shoot harpoons at the Revelation's view screen, trying to break it (which Carcy can use Mending to fix). The Itisal has 8 harpoons, which each do 3 damage.

The party can combat this however they want.

[Encounter link, player view](https://www.improved-initiative.com/p/zi8my0q4)

- The Itisal will try to shoot one harpoon per turn `1d20 + 3` to hit, Revelation has `AC 10`
- If Aicha sees that they can communicate, she'll immediately stop attacking.
- They can maneuver the ship with a `DC 10 Intelligence Check` followed by a `DC 10 Dexterity Check`.
- Carcy can use Mending to repair the viewscreen by 2 HP.
- If the viewscreen is destroyed, water will flood into the Revelation, and the crew will have one round before they're submerged. If they don't find a way to keep breathing, they'll go unconscious and will be picked up by the Itisal, whose crew will realize that they're not monsters, put them in the spacesuits, and save them.

Upon realizing that they can communicate, Aicha will take out a small pink vial and spray something into her gills. She'll then look for gills on the party, and she'll have to figure out that they breathe through their mouths. After they ingest the crystal's dust, they will be able to talk with the Marids.

Aicha will introduce the crew of the Itisal:

- Farrokh
- Rami
- Hayat
- Yosef

She's the captain, but every member of the crew can take over any responsibility on the ship.

She offers to escort the crew to the [Citadel](../World/Poseidon/Citadel.md).

### 3. Welcome to the Citadel

NOTE: Have the Shabah do a few ghostly things at times, so that they can be introduced by their Marid hosts.

Around midday, the Itisal and the Revelation (or just the Itisal?) travel to the Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls, which takes around half an hour.

It's an enormous spherical colony of pink coral, surrounded by massive (the size of houses) floating pearls, which give off a pale blue light at night. A mix of rectangular and (more fancy seeming) arc shaped dark green buildings cover the top of the colony, and similar structures hang from its underside. As they get closer, they start to see large lanes of seemingly uncovered coral zigzagging across the surface, and as they get even closer, they see that those lanes are demarcated by dark blue O-shaped pylons with a diameter of about 60 ft. At some points, the lanes meet at very large circular vortices, which are surrounded by pylons.

Aicha offers to house the crew at her house on the underside of the Citadel, if they're not staying in the Revelation. The house has a [Laminite](../NPCs/Laminites.md) signpost outside.

She'll go in first to prepare her family for the aliens.

Her house is a lot like the houses the party is used to, and they have a guest room with bunk beds the party can stay in. It's a little awkward to be in the spacesuits, so Aicha gives them dark green billowy clothes that hide their bodies with hoods that hide their faces. Later that night, Aicha's husband [Habib](../NPCs/Laminites/Habib.md) tinkers with their helmets to move the oxygen tank to the base of the neck of the helmet so that it's more hidden.

To get oxygen, they'll have to use the Revelation's gas generator, which is a hot-water-heater-sized tank that operates on solar power, which they could bring to Aicha's house if they wanted. For food, they can pass it through an airlock compartment on their helmets.

### 4. Free roam

The next day, Aicha and Habib are going to a meeting of the Laminites, and their kids are going to school. They say that they can't stop the crew wandering the city as long as they're careful, and they'll think about what to do with them over the course of the day. Aicha and Habib are pretty chill.

The crew can do whatever they want in the Citadel (likely, find Lux).

The main way of getting around is the Currents. You can't control where you go at intersections of the currents, but the dark blue pylons are set up so that you can use them as off-ramps (they've got an angle to them to guide a rider off like an off-ramp for a highway).

Lux was hiding within the kelp farmland, taking crops to eat. They've taken the form of a Marid (spacesuit can be hidden by shapechange), and while they haven't been able to communicate with the Marids, they've been allowed to hide in a barn on the edge of the farmland under the custody of a farmer named [Charbel](../NPCs/Charbel.md).

I have a feeling Carcy is going to want to go to a library. The closest library to Aicha's house is the Altaarikh Library. It's on the side of the Citadel in the schools, office buildings, etc. zone. It has large glass windows that look out to the ocean, where a few small chunks of earth can be seen floating by. There they can learn the history of the Citadel.

Session ends when they find Lux.

## Table Notes

Have archivists' guild send Carcy info on shapechangers involved with the mission (done, figured out that Lux was probably the imposter)

Oxygen lasts one day outside of ship

How do the Marids make stuff with their fins? I'll just say that they're very dextrous

I decided that the ship was grown instead of constructed

They're planning to do something with a balloon in order to test the force pushing them down

Lux swim towards Royal Guard Housing 1

They refilled their suit by a quarter (for 6 hours of air)

Carcy (and others) are suspicious that the cultures are so similar

Carcy wants to known what the protocols are if aliens show up

She'll also go to the library

They're also suspicious of the nobility

Mu is going to go to meet the farmer

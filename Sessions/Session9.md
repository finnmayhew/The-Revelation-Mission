# Session 9

## Prep

Things to happen:

- Confer with the Padishah
  - She's the only one who knows where Hestia is
  - How can they convince her to help them?
- Leverage the Shabahs' power to get them back to Hestia
  - Will probably need the combined (intelligence and strength) of the Padishah and the strength of the Shabah
  - Remember that the Shabah cannot communicate — but they must all somehow end up guiding the ship — needs a creative solution

# Session 9

## Prep

Things to happen:

- Confer with the Padishah
  - She's the only one who knows where Hestia is
  - How can they convince her to help them?
- Leverage the Shabahs' power to get them back to Hestia
  - Will probably need the combined (intelligence and strength) of the Padishah and the strength of the Shabah
  - Remember that the Shabah cannot communicate — but they must all somehow end up guiding the ship — needs a creative solution

Thoughts:

- The Padishah is condescending
  - Understands the morality of what she’s doing and does it anyway, admittedly because she wants power
- Her big question is, how do the Hestians have magic?
  - The party is her best resource on this, so she’s fine with revealing that she’s been doing something to stop the Hestians from developing magic, which apparently hasn’t been working
  - She’s also all right with telling them most things because she’s so much more powerful than them that she can risk it — she’s outwardly cocky
  - BUT, she critically tells them not quite enough information for them to figure out how to get back to Hestia, because she wants to avoid Hestia sending future missions to Poseidon, and figures if the Revelers don’t come back, they’ll avoid future missions
- What can she ask them without giving the whole thing away?
  - Can ask them about the Gliss and it moving around (checking that that’s really happening)
  - Can ask if there are regions on Hestia where people are born without magic, or if, across the entire surface, there’s an equal chance that everyone is born with magic (on my part this is language that’s deliberately close to that of image charges and equipotentials)
  - The meta idea is that this gives them a jumpstart in figuring it out
- The reason she can’t put together that the Shabah are countering her Gliss movement is that she doesn’t believe them to be intelligent enough to do that — it doesn’t even occur to her
- If the crew figures out what’s going on and lets that info slip, the Padishah will want to destroy the Shabah to stop them from moving Poseidon’s Sun — but she critically can’t leave the palace, because then her Shabah would escape
  - If she puts it together before the party (how?), she’ll try to make a deal with them: she’ll modify their ship to give it water destruction blasters, and if they blast away all the water around the Sun, she’ll send them home
- How is she controlling her captive Shabah?
  - Under the threat that if it leaves, she’ll kill it with a destroy water spell before she dies
- She’ll not let the party out until she figures out why the Hestians have magic
  - How can she prevent them from escaping?
- If the party does destroy water around her, she’ll try to dash away, and if she fails, they will kill the Shabah, which will kill her due to being her phylactery
  - But, that means they need to find another way home
- How can they get the Shabah to coordinate to send them through the Darkened Depths?
  - OR, they could get the Padishah to do it with currents
  - OR, they could steal the Stormrider’s Pearl and do it themselves with currents
- What are the ways out of the Palace / Reception Hall?
- Can the Padishah be convinced to help them?
- Can the Padishah be convinced to stop the currents?
- Is fighting not an option?
- How can I prevent them from getting to a stalemate?

### 1. Reception



The Padishah has all the powers

### 2. Escape

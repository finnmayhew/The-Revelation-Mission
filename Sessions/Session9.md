# Session 9

## Prep

### 1. The Center of the Palace

![The Center of the Palace](../World/Images/The%20Center.jpg)

When the party entered the air room, their guardian Shabahs stayed behind, and therefore the party will not have them while they're in the center of the palace. However, the center of the palace is surrounded by layers of tightly packed coral, so the water pressure is not dangerously high there.

After blasting through the moonpool, the party find themselves in a deep purple coral hallway that curves and opens up into a larger, bright space not visible from the moonpool. After they come through the moonpool, coral builds to cover it.

Swimming down the hallway, they find it open up to a 100ft by 50ft by 50ft room of purple coral. There are six ornate black kelp pillars running on down its length, three on either side of a smooth dark grey stone path leading to the far side of the room. Seated at her throne is [Padishah Kalbari](../NPCs/Kalbari.md), wearing a red and gold robe. There are red whispy lines radiating out from her that end in vague claw shapes clutching the coral on the inside surface of the hall (this is her [Dominate Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dominate-monster) controlling the surrounding coral).

The Padishah's goal here is to figure out how the Hestians have magic. Key things:

- She'll divulge anything to the party except for things that reveal the relative locations of Hestia and Poseidon.
  - This is becaues she wants to prevent the crew from returning to Hestia, because she wants the mission to be considered a failure so Hestians do not come back.
- She is adamant that the Shabah do not have intelligence.
  - This is a self-delusion she's propagated since using the captive Shabah as her phylactery.
- She wants to keep them here just so she can use their knowledge to figure out why the Hestians have magic.
  - She's not entirely knowledgable on what magic the party has, so she realizes it's possible they'll escape using some ability she's not familiar with.
  - But in her mind, she is their only way home, so they'll come back eventually.

If she does figure out that it's the Shabah moving Poseidon's sun (piece of logic needed: the Shabah are intelligent, and there's a cluser of them near the Sun), she'll make a deal with the crew: she'll put a single-use current-creating blaster on the Revelation, and if they create a current that surrounds the sun and funnels all Shabah that get near it to the Darkened Depths, she'll send them home. With some faith, the single charge could instead be used to send the Revelation through the Darkened Depths and back to Hestia. If they refuse, the Padishah will say that she can convince someone else to do it, and will attempt to kill the party.

The Padishah has all the powers that are granted to her as a [Lich](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16943-lich), and through magic items she has either found or crafted:

- The power to control the currents (the Stormrider's Pearl)
- The power to control the Gliss (a solid pink sphere)
- The power to cast an extra-powerful version of [Mirage Arcane](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Mirage%20Arcane#content) (a vial of nectar)

All these objects are hidden away in a private room guarded by coral.

One way the party can escape is by convincing the coral to simply move aside. Contesting this is the Padishah's [Dominate Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dominate-monster) spell â€” so to counter it, they must make her break [Concentration](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells#toc_22) (her other Concentration spells are [Globe of Invulnerability](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/globe-of-invulnerability), [Scrying](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/scrying), [Cloudkill](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cloudkill), [Detect Thoughts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-thoughts), [Invisibility](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/invisibility), and [Detect Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-magic)).

### 2. The End

I have no idea what the party will do. The ending will follow from whatever happens in the center of the palace, and the hope is that I've given them enough tools to be able to enact their will and discover how to return to Hestia.

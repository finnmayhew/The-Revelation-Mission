# Session 4

## Prep

### 1. Carcy breaks off, Norvin comes back online

Carcy heads over to Aicha's to help out the Itisal on their fishing trip for the day.

Norvin, you suddenly reactivate, and in doing so you realize that it feels like you're kind of like settling into your body, like the energy that animates you has reduced to a manageable level, and you've gone through the bifurcation point between your body being a chaotic system and your body being predictable and operational.

Roleplay Norvin coming back online. It's mostly an opportunity for the party to fill Emmett in on what they've missed.

### 2. Mu and [Charbel](../NPCs/Charbel.md)

Next, Mu heads to the farm buildings to consult with Charbel. She's interested in getting some small creature to use in their experiments with the limit.

Charbel is fine with this, and gives her a live salamander in a mason jar.

He also explains the currency, which are small pearls of different metallic colors strung together on cords and worn not too tightly around the arm.

He does ask that, in exchange for letting them hide in his kelp farm, the crew use their magic to help out the [Laminites](../NPCs/Laminites.md): "I'm not asking you to do anything that would jeopardize your mission of getting back to your home, but if you do get an opportunity, whatever you could do to help out the Laminites' cause, that would be a big help for me. Coming up's gonna be the second Wake that I've been through as a farmer, and it's a real difficult process to navigate, especially as the only person who runs this farm. And I think the Wake's gonna come sooner than usual, the single-fiber kelp is taking longer to settle than it usually does."

Some roleplaying, then Mu heads back to the rest of the crew.

### 3. Scrying

After Mu gets back, ground control's Scrying spell takes effect.

Sarnos, you feel a sudden pressure on your mind. What do you do?

If he recognizes it as the Scrying spell, he can accept it and it'll vanish. If he doesn't accept it, roll a `Wisdom Save (DC 10)` to resist. With an `Arcana Check (DC 10)`, anyone can remember that the spell lasts 10 minutes.

Then the party can communicate whatever they want (visually and verbally) back to ground control. There'll be an opportunity to do this once per day (in universe, because the spell is taxing to do, even for an advanced magician).

Ground control will hear the Shabah knocking on the ship during the Scrying.

On the ship's two remaining [Sending Stones](../Sending_Stones.md) for the day:

> Is the ship's structural integrity holding? We can hear a knocking sound from the hull. Over.

(after they respond, likely verbally)

> We'll work on this. If possible, document the imposter's spells and abilities and display or describe to us for future problem solving. Over.

### X. First Contact

I really want Brandon to come to this at least partially on his own.

This will require Lux to be out of the ship, so it'll be an act of trust that they'll stay there, and show of good faith on their part if they actually do.

As soon as Lux's guardian Shabah realizes that it can understand the crew:

Lux, you feel an invisible tug on your hand, like someone is asking you to come with them. What do you do?

If they reject it: you feel a small thump in the water around you, and (whoever else), you feel that same tug on your hand.

To whoever is the first to accept:

"You feel a strong force pull you horizontally through the water, but you don't feel any significant physical resistance. You begin to essentially glide through the water, faster and faster, and your trajectory slowly turns upwards. The Citadel shrinks in your view, and you realize you're headed straight for the limit, and all at once, you are no longer underwater. You are in space, and you can see the stars around you, and the sun, and in this brief moment, you think you can see the green and blue orb of Hestia in the far distance. But you don't feel weightless, and you find yourself falling downwards, and then you're gliding through water again, down to the Citadel, and you kind of spiral into a rest in front of the crew."

Then, the crew can essentially do the yes/no questions game with Lux's guardian Shabah. They'll learn up to as much as the Shabah know and can communicate. The Shabah want them to go into the palace and deliver them the captured Shabah, and in exchange they'll bring the crew through the Darkened Depths to the Underdark.

### X. Probing the Darkened Depths

Going down towards the Darkened Depths, things more dense than water sink slower and things less dense than water rise slower. This gives a sluggish feel to everything this far down.

Far down in the Darkened Depths is a [Charybdis](https://www.5esrd.com/database/creature/charybdis/).

It's far enough down that it's not very visible right at the boundary, but you can see a huge form far down, like a big circle facing up, with some shifting forms inside.

If the ship is in a dire situation, have the Shabah pull the ship up and away from the Darkened Depths.

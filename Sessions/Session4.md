# Session 4

## Prep

Things:

- Prompt Lux to try to communicate with the Shabah using Tongues
- Somehow have the location of the ship be revealed?
- Norvin wakes up with a sense that they were knocked out because their energy was too high, and may have the insight that their energy comes from magic
- Something to kickstart the Revelers into heading on the path to the secret backstory

Carcy will join the Itisal on a fishing trip.

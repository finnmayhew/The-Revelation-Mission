## Prep

### 0. Playing Lux

### 1. Scrying on the Padishah

### 2. Entrance Trial

Note that, if their plan works, the fight described below will be entirely bypassed.

They take the currents to the very top of the Citadel, and there's a kind of roundabout-style off-ramp that curves in a large radius around the entrance to the palace. They use it to exit the currents and swim down to the building.

The entrance to the palace is a series of interlocking single-fiber arches at different angles and heights that connect in a single large hexagon at their bases, which acts as a clear delineator of where the Challenge starts. Inside the hexagon, the ground is smooth, white sand, that seems to be packed down, and at the center the sand slopes up to form a 10-feet-wide volcano-looking circular opening to the palace below. The opening is covered by three tight, long nets, which are attached to the base of the arches. Each net has an AC of 10 and takes 10 hit points to break.

There are three Marid royal guards (Miriam, Eleni, and Kostas, see collective character sheet) wearing golden ringed armor sitting on the sloped surface leading up to the opening. They seem to be chatting.

The difficulty here is not necessarily knocking the guards out, but having the guards not realize that they're aliens. If the guards see their helmets, they'll ask about them, but they'll have to roll `Investigation DC 10` to see through them. If they see the party using magic, that's also a good sign that something's up. If they notice, they'll think they're monsters and will try to rush to a certain spot on the perimeter of the hexagon to light the alarm beacon, then they'll try extra hard to prevent the party from entering the palace.

When the party approaches the hexagon, the guards get up and swim over to towards them casually. They'll ask if they're here for the Challenge. They'll explain that passing them acts as a first stage, and that things will get very tough inside the palace. There's also royal guards whose job it is to patrol the Challenge section of the palace and rescue anyone trapped, but they only patrol every few days.

Then they fight.

The guards can each cast Fog Cloud with a 20-ft radius once, which is not magic, but uses a large leaf to stir up the sand and obscure the area (the sand will coat the helmets of the PCs, causing them to be `Blinded`, until they take an action to remove it). Then they'll swim to the outside and take kelp vines from the arches and try to wrap up the party (the arches are lined up so that they'd end up wrapped up not at the center). That takes one action, and makes whoever is ensnared `Restrained`, which can be broken out of with a `Strength Check DC 15` or a relevant spell.

### The Layout of the Challenge

Descend from entrance through a hatch into the Octopus Room.

The Octopus Room has, seemingly, three passageways leading out from it, with a tentacle pointing to each (don't immediately mention this). Following four of the other tentacles leads to coral walls, and the final tentacle points back up to the entrance.

Two of the doors lead to the first two trials, and once everyone's entered a trial, the doors close behind them.

### First Trial

### Second Trial

### Third Trial

### X. Captured

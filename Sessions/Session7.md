# Session 7

## Prep

### 0. Playing Lux

Brandon:

> 🤷‍♂️ probably be generally unhelpful except to preserve my own skin, and, if anyone else is saved, that's a bonus.

### 1. Scrying on the Padishah

### 2. Entrance Trial

Note that, if their plan works, the fight described below will be entirely bypassed.

They take the currents to the very top of the Citadel, and there's a kind of roundabout-style off-ramp that curves in a large radius around the entrance to the palace. They use it to exit the currents and swim down to the building.

The entrance to the palace is a series of interlocking single-fiber arches at different angles and heights that connect in a single large hexagon at their bases, which acts as a clear delineator of where the Challenge starts. Inside the hexagon, the ground is smooth, white sand, that seems to be packed down, and at the center the sand slopes up to form a 10-feet-wide volcano-looking circular opening to the palace below. The opening is covered by three tight, long nets, which are attached to the base of the arches. Each net has an AC of 10 and takes 10 hit points to break.

There are three Marid royal guards (Miriam, Eleni, and Kostas, see collective character sheet) wearing golden ringed armor sitting on the sloped surface leading up to the opening. They seem to be chatting.

The difficulty here is not necessarily knocking the guards out, but having the guards not realize that they're aliens. If the guards see their helmets, they'll ask about them, but they'll have to roll `Investigation DC 10` to see through them. If they see the party using magic, that's also a good sign that something's up. If they notice, they'll think they're monsters and will try to rush to a certain spot on the perimeter of the hexagon to light the alarm beacon, then they'll try extra hard to prevent the party from entering the palace.

When the party approaches the hexagon, the guards get up and swim over to towards them casually. They'll ask if they're here for the Challenge. They'll explain that passing them acts as a first stage, and that things will get very tough inside the palace. There's also royal guards whose job it is to patrol the Challenge section of the palace and rescue anyone trapped, but they only patrol every few days.

Then they fight.

The guards can each cast Fog Cloud with a 20-ft radius once, which is not magic, but uses a large leaf to stir up the sand and obscure the area (the sand will coat the helmets of the PCs, causing them to be `Blinded`, until they take an action to remove it). Then they'll swim to the outside and take kelp vines from the arches and try to wrap up the party (the arches are lined up so that they'd end up wrapped up not at the center). That takes one action, and makes whoever is ensnared `Restrained`, which can be broken out of with a `Strength Check DC 15` or a relevant spell.

### 3. The Challenge

![The Challenge](../World/Images/The%20Challenge.jpg)

From the gate, the players descend 100 ft through a slightly curvy 10-ft-wide coral-walled passageway, the color of which turns from a bright pink to a deep purple as they get farther from the surface of the colony. The passage is lit with flecks of neon red bioluminescence evenly distributed across the the walls.

Then, the passageway opens up into blackness.

Assuming they can find a way to see, they find that this is a roughly hemispherical room with a diameter of about 50 ft, with a height of about 40 ft. However, there are no easily defined walls to the room — instead, the deep purple coral fractals away over the course of 15 or so ft until it's too small to pass through. The floor is solid, made out of very thick, almost wood-like black kelp.

Everyone roll `Insight DC 10`. On a failure, they'll at first think there's a real octopus at the base of the room.

At the center of the room is a realistic life-size bronze statue of a large octopus. Its tentacles point radially away from it.

If examined, the crew will find that the octopus has seven tentacles pointing horizontally, with one is missing. But if they swim to quickly near it, they'll find that the bronze is thin and brittle, and can be broken easily. The one that was pointing up was broken by the force of the nearby currents and is trapped against the wall at the end of the looping passage.

Red light comes from three passageways leading out of this room (the crew may notice that three of the octopus's tentacles are pointing to those three, and four seemingly unremarkable other sections of the wall).

When they get close to it, they'll find that one of the three passageways has a current pulling water into it. Going down that one is another long winding passage of the same dimensions as the entrance passage, but this time mostly horizontal. After about a minute of traveling down it, it seems to come to an end. They'll spot the missing octopus tentacle here, pinned against the wall. When everyone is at the very end, the coral organically moves to seal behind them, and then the coral in front of them crawls away, and then the current moves them back into the main room, with the coral that had formed behind them building forward to become flush with the previous wall. They'll find themselves opposite the passageway they'd entered from, and the missing tentacle, if not grabbed, is pulled back into the current.

Moving backwards through the door as it's shifting, the current suddenly stops, and then reverses direction, moving strongly. After a few turns, the passage arcs downward, then opens into a smaller hemispherical room, about 15 ft in diameter — except the flat part of the hemisphere — covered with a similar black kelp — is at the top of the room, and the curved surfaces is along the bottom. Illuminating the room is a blue stone ring of light with a diameter of 10 ft, and in relief around the surface of the ring are three shapes — a starfish, a seahorse, and a jellyfish. The hole of the ring leads down through to another passageway, which the party is sucked through immediately — meaning that they don't get a good luck at the ring of light unless they find a way to stop themselves. The passageway twists and turns and becomes more horizontal, then opens up back into the main room, with the coral building back behind the party.

After they get all three sea creatures from the trials and place them along the ring, the passageway below will turn to the same glowing blue stone as the ring and suck them down it. This one dumps them into a dark, grey stone hallway, which surprisingly, is filled with air. There's a few puddles around where they land, but it otherwise seems dry, and the water is held in place above them somehow. The hallway slowly curves upward vertically (which they should figure out how to scale), and ends in a shimmering ceiling, which is the reverse-moonpool leading into the Reception Hall.

The other two open passages leading from the main room lead to the first two trials. The trials begin only once everyone is inside, and the coral builds behind them to keep them in. Once they've finished a trial, the coral opens back up, and leads them down a much quicker passage to the main room, which builds behind them again once everyone's through. Each trial exits to passage that opens across the room to its entrance.

Heading up in the central room leads to a passage that, while still moving up, has coral walls that turn from the deep purple of the rest of the Challenge's coral into a dark grey. This leads to the third trial.

#### First Trial

The first trial is the Labyrinth two-doors-one-always-tells-the-truth-and-the-other-always-lies puzzle.

The room for this trial is small and can be mistaken for an extension of the passageway that came before, which is composed of coral that turns more and more orange as the passage continues (so the door closing may catch them by surprise). There are two circular Hobbit-hole-like doors, one made of red kelp, the other made of blue kelp. Each has a handle. There is an inscription over the doors, written in Maridian, which reads (Carcy may have to use Comprehend Languages):

> One tells the truth and one lies. Before opening, ask one a single question, and learn which door leads to success.

They can simply address a door verbally for this, which works with Aicha's powder magic. The door will respond by using a current in some way.

Both doors are always openable, but they will not answer a question after either of them has been opened. Behind them is, maybe surprisingly, a single small coral room, within which swim maybe 40 small sea creatures. Investigation will reveal that there are exactly two of each type of sea creature, and also that there are hooks along the centerline, which might have once held a net separating two enclosures of the sea creatures. The starfish that they'll eventually be after is the particular starfish that was originally in enclosure behind the correct door. They can figure out which starfish is which using Speak with Animals or some other method (or they can just take both and try both, which might just take more time).

#### Second Trial

The second trial's room is a seemingly empty spherical room with a 50 ft diameter and bright white coral.

As soon as all the party enters, the gateway builds out behind them, and, unlike the other trial rooms, the coral keeps building out. In fact, on a `Perception DC 10` roll, the party finds that the coral is growing towards them from all sides — the room is shrinking Star Wars trash compactor style.

Handle this as a skill challenge:

- Success
  - Require 4
  - Success state: they exit the room
- Failure
  - Require 3
  - Failure state: they're trapped in the room for long enough that they gain 1 Exhaustion
- Complications (6) — on every success, the coral bounces backwards a bit
  - Right as the door starts closing, someone's guardian Shabah darts away from them towards the opening, causing a sudden change in water pressure that catches you off guard — whoever else has the highest Passive Insight (first person is temporarily Stunned) roll `Ins DC 10` to see if they know what happened
    - On failure, disadvantage on the below complication roll as the Shabah is almost out by the time someone else notices
  - Then, someone (if the info was communicated), what do you do to convince the Shabah to come back?
    - On failure, that party member is pulled right next to another party member by another Shabah to keep their water pressure equalized, and must stay near them until their guardian Shabah returns at the end of the trial
  - A blunt pillar of coral shoots out and tries to bludgeon a character — default, roll `Dex DC 15`
    - On failure, take `1d8 Bludgeoning damage`
  - Currents start up in the room and send everyone flying into the center of the room, in an attempt to crash them into each other
    - On failure, everyone crashes into each other and takes `1d10 Bludgeoning damage`
  - A small jellyfish swimming around zaps someone, causing them to drop whatever they're holding — how does someone quickly catch whatever is dropped?
    - On failure, the item is temporarily lost
  - The coral closes in and threatens to immobilize everyone — requires a creative solution
    - On failure, everyone is Restrained, and the skill challenge's failure condition is triggered

On a success, the room becomes inert and the gateway opens back up.

The jellyfish is hard to spot, but can be spotted at any point or returned to.

#### Third Trial

The entrance to the third trial seems to be blocked. The PCs have to cut through the coral to get through, and on the other side they find, strangely, a bedroom. It doesn't look like a Hestian bedroom, or like the design of the interior of Aicha and Habib's house. There's a Maridian man in his 20s sleeping in the bed, and if they look through the windows of the room, they'll find the dark ocean.

Outside this house, they'll find a [Mirage Arcane](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Mirage%20Arcane#content)'s recreation of Almuhbasa. The layout of the city is like Ted Chiang's Tower of Babel — large slopes spiralling around the outside and buildings on the inside of an enormous, slightly swaying coral long coral branch reaching from down in the Darkened Depths.

Totally improvise any encounters they may have in the city. It'll seem real — although since they've never been to Almuhbasa, they don't have much to compare it against. I expect they won't stay here long, since they're focused on the Challenge.

After being shocked at the appearance of the party (both the fact that they appear and how unfamiliar they look, being aliens), the man introduces himself as Omar. He says he lives on Almuhbasa, and two days ago while visiting the Citadel, he decided to take on the Challenge just to see if he could (have him present with the same stats as the guards from the entrance trial). This was the first trial he took on after entering the Challenge, and it seems the trial played with his mind and successfully convinced him that he had never come to the Citadel and that he was back home.

Omar identifies himself as a natural philosopher. He's studying the nature of the sun, and came to the Citadel to see if he could observe it from another angle. He was surprised to find that the sun remained directly overhead at the Citadel.

(In reality, Omar is a projection of the Padishah Kalbari (some spell?), as is everyone on the fake Almuhbasa. She's taken on this persona to gather information about the party after learning that there was something suspicious going on around the Citadel — maybe someone spotted the Revelation landing once. She prompts the party with this knowledge to see if they've figured out the true shape of Poseidon, and she figures that letting that bit of knowledge slip would be fine, because she can just capture them if she wants once they make it through the trial. Her main motivation at this point is curiosity.)

Improvise Omar's involvement in the rest of the Challenge. When either the players run out of options or discover Omar's deception, Omar will smile, say something like "see you soon", and kind of resolve into Vecna-like snaking coral, which will fall away, revealing a seahorse in Omar's place.

The third trial uses the same passageway for its entrance and exit.

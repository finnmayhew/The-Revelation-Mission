# Session Zero

## Prep

Goals are

1. Set expectations
2. Introduce characters
3. Introduce setting

### 1. Set expectations

See list at [this link](https://www.level1geek.com/dnd-session-0/).

### 2. Introduce characters

This can be totally out of character, just go around the table and have players describe who each character is, at least publicly.

Main questions:

- What drove your character to join the Revelation crew?
- What role does your character play aboard the Revelation?

### 3. Introduce setting

You all blast off from the launch site off the Darian coast.

Contact to Revelation ground control, based in Daria, is through a set of three pairs of [sending stones](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sending_stones), which each allow a transmission and response, each up to 25 words, per day (the idea is to do check-ins at every meal). Messages are textual, with the stones gaining temporary Buddha-board-esque magical engravings.

After the Revelation exits the atmosphere, the crew receives a message on the day's first sending stone:

> Gliss is holding position. No issues with liftoff on our end. Report? Over.

(Then they respond with whatever they want.)

You all settle in for the trip. It's expected to be only hours before you enter orbit around the Gliss, but since all readings so far are nominal, you have the chance to converse, and if you can, relax as Hestia slowly gets smaller outside the Revelation's windows. (maybe prompt: What is everyone doing?)

(They can try out roleplaying here.)

Everyone make a `Perception Check (DC 10)`. On a failure, they only notice the following once they go totally weightless. On a success, they notice that they're getting lighter much sooner than expected (still much closer to Hestia than to the Gliss), and they have a chance to do something before they become totally weightless.

After becoming weightless, they start to feel a pull in the direction of the Gliss. It starts small, but quickly gets stronger and stronger, and the ship rotates so that you're able to stand on the floor again. Norvin, you get an alert that thrusters will no longer be able to compensate for the pull, and you'll have to slingshot around the Gliss in order to get back to Hestia (which was the plan the whole time â€” but it's happening much sooner than expected).

Then two things happen at once:

- Norvin, you notice that you have much more energy than you should, like you just drank a ton of energy drinks or connected extra energy cells. And as the Revelation accelerates towards the Gliss, your energy seems to be growing faster and faster, uncontrollably. (Ask Emmett what that looks like for Norvin).

- Sarnos, you feel a sudden heat in your suit pocket, which you know means you've received a personal sending stone communication from ground control. The message reads:

> URGENT: There is a Changeling aboard masquerading as First Officer Ollim. You are ordered to restrain them. Copy? Over.

At this point, Norvin, you're starting to black out, which will result in loss of control of the thrusters. You check the course reading and notice that the Revelation is starting to veer more directly towards the Gliss. Roll a `Constitution Saving Throw (DC 10)`. On a success you have the chance to take one more action.

(They take an action.)

While that's happening, Sarnos, what do you do? May provoke something like a `Performance / Insight` contest between Sarnos and Lux.

(They take an action. Maybe roleplaying ensues.)

Soon after this, if they haven't already everyone notices that Norvin is unconscious and that the ship is veering towards the Gliss. They can try to heal Norvin or manually steer the ship themselves. If they succeed on both an `Intelligence Check (DC 15)` and a `Dexterity Check (DC 10)` they can slow the ship down enough that the check to stay conscious when the Revelation hits the Gliss reduces from a `Constitution Check (DC 20)` to a `Constitution Check (DC 15)`.

There's one more moment before the Revelation hits the Gliss. If anyone looks out the window, with an `Perception Check (DC 10)` they'll see that the Gliss is covered with water.

(One more quick chance for an action.)

There's a monumental pressure and sound as the Revelation hits the surface of the Gliss. The view out of the windows is murky, and you feel the ship being pulled down, even faster than you would expect from what it would be like if it were just sinking, although maybe your perception is distorted in the moment.

Everyone but Norvin (assuming they're unconscious) roll a `Constitution Check (DC 20/15)` to remain conscious for a moment longer. For those who succeed:

You see, in the distance, a single, massive free floating pink ball. Roll a `Nature Check (DC 10) with disadvantage`. On a success, as you pass out and the Revelation sinks deeper into the endless ocean, you realize what you're looking at is a colony of coral.

# Session Zero

## Prep

Goals are

1. Introduce characters
2. Introduce setting

### 1. Introduce characters

This can be totally out of character, just going around the table and describing who each character is, at least publicly.

Main questions:

- What drove your character to join the Revelation crew?
- What role does your character play aboard the Revelation?

### 2. Introduce setting

This will be a narration with a few quick-time-event-style decisions and checks.

TO DO: write this

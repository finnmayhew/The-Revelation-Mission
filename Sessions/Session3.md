# Session 3

## Prep

We left off in the evening (of Hali 6941).

Sarnos and Carcy were leaving Aicha and Habib's, Sarnos heading back to the Revelation and Carcy heading to the Altaarikh Library.

Lux is trapped on the Revelation, as is a mysteriously inactive Norvin.

Mu is wrapping up her day with Charbel.

Let's go to the Revelation first, where we can have Sarnos and Mu run into each other as they're about to open the airlock.

### 1. The Situation on the Revelation

Sarnos and Mu enter the ship to find Norvin frozen in the hallway between the bridge and the sleeping quarters. What is Lux doing at this point? They could have heard the airlock activating.

(Have things play out via roleplaying, and cut to Carcy at a natural point before the day ends.)

They can use Habib's modified canisters and the ship's gas generator to allow for helmet-only travel outside the ship. Based on Lux's good role last session, there's probably no chance that they'll spot that the gas generator was removed and replaced (although maybe Norvin could in the future).

### 2. The Altaarikh Library

Most buildings on the underside they've come across that are made of compressed kelp have been blocky, and customized from mass-produced housing modules. More expensive buildings are built from a single thick fiber of kelp, fostered in a similar way that kelp for ship-construction is.

The Altaarikh Library is not the biggest single-fiber building Carcy's seen (that's the entrance to the palace on Topside), but it does have a unique design. Individual strands of compressed kelp are curled in overlapping spiral patterns, making a relief pattern on the walls, and on the inside — unlike the insides of the other buildings they've seen — the compressed kelp is left mostly as-is, rather than fitted to be more square and organized.

The main organizational difference to libraries Carcy is familiar with is that the Altaarikh Library is organized pretty vertically, which makes sense given that people can swim up to grab books. Every shelf has two thin cords, one running near the top and one running near the bottom, which are meant to prevent Shabah from throwing books out of the bookshelves.

Books are bound with thin, dark seaweed, and pages are some light green fibrous material. Words are printed with ink, and not readable with Aicha's powder, but are readable with Carcy's Comprehend Languages.

Carcy can figure out where different sections are by sampling books arbitrarily, or by talking with a librarian.

Much of the Citadel's fiction is about the monsters from the [Darkened Depths](../World/Poseidon/Darkened_Depths.md). Carcy will learn that a characteristic of monsters is that they can't communicate, and (if she reads/skims a significant amount) a common plot point in horror fiction is when a character realizes that someone has magically been mimicking communication (revealing that they're a monster). There is no other concept of aliens, in fiction or nonfiction (Aicha and Habib's children used the word in the "outsider" sense).

The Marids have explored all of Poseidon that lies between the limit and the Darkened Depths. There are a number of other coral structures, although they're much smaller (and not considered "colonies", even though some have people who live there).

The most populated of the non-Citadel coral colonies is [Almuhbasa](../World/Poseidon/Almuhbasa.md), which is about a week's travel away by Maridian ship. It's where a lot of scholars and writers live, as the Citadel is very focused on industry. Even on Almuhbasa, there's not much concept of a "scientist", but there are "natural philosophers", who do a lot of theorizing and not a lot of experimentation. Natural philosophy is considered a pretty niche interest, and not a ton is documented at Altaarikh about their groups and research.

Most nonfiction is histories of different people and different eras of the Citadel. They learn about the way eras are named and they devastation caused by the Wake, and that some writers blame the Shabah for the Wake.

People may notice that Carcy looks strange for a Marid, but unless she does something super strange most people will not be too suspicious. When Carcy is reading, she will spot one man who is looking at her extra suspiciously (give her the opportunity to do address that). If she doesn't address that, the man will follow her out, and track down the Revelation. Then the session will end with, sometime the next day, a large net being cast over the Revelation, and an unfamiliar Maridian submarine plated with silver-colored armor descends into the viewscreen.

### 3. Hali 6942

When the next day comes, have the ship's fist sending stone be lit, and also Carcy will have received a message from the Archivists' Guild.

Message from ground control:

> Gliss has moved far away. Hired an advanced magician capable of scrying. When one of you senses a presence, do not resist observation. Report? Over.

Message from the Archivists' Guild:

> Can't find any mythical record of a water world. Re: physics at the limit, we're finding magicians and scientists of historically water-based kingdoms for consultation.

At the end of the day, Aicha will come to the ship to report back about the pressure experiment: everything she releases retains constant water pressure. She tested this with whatever balloon-like thing Carcy used.

### X. Shabah science

Carcy's See Invisibility does not work on them because they are not invisible, they are made of water. She can still see into the Ethereal though. In the Ethereal, things are not subject to gravity, but they are still subject to the magic force — so going there or transporting things there can disentangle gravity and the magic force.

Carcy's Detect Thoughts does not work on them because they don't speak any language, and she cannot use it to detect Shabah for the same reason.

---

Remember that Elinore won't be at next session, and see if there's a natural thing to separate Carcy from the party.

Norvin should turn back on at the end of the session.

## Table Notes

Question: why does Poseidon have a 24-hour cycle

They are going to teleport Lux above the limit

Man at library was thinking that Carcy was not a monster after she talked with him, but was suspicious — did see her using magic to do comprehend languages

Idea: day dedicated for fishing

Gave them a sample of Aicha's powder

From the powder: Aicha's powder is from deep within the earth

TODO: name the rock!

Mu is off to talk to Charbel

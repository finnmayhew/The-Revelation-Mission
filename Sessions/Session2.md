# Session 2

## Prep

### 0. Plans

Norvin's plans (Emmett absent):

- Stay with the ship and do maintenance

Mu's plans (Brooke absent):

- Meet the farmer and explore the farm
  - What kind of animals do they have?
- Generally exploring
- Either go with Norvin or report back to it

Carcy's plans:

(1-3 soon, 4-10 future)

1. Figure out if Mu can communicate with the Citadel itself ✓
2. Take first watch on the Revelation while she writes notes ✓
3. Attempt to team up with Lux
4. Investigate the limit
    1. with balloon and rope
    2. with returning spear
5. Update ground control, get them working on solutions (I can use this as a "hints" system)
6. Update the Archivists Guild
7. Go to the nearest library
    1. Learn about the Marid exploration of Poseidon, for making a backup plan if the Revelers have to leave the Citadel
8. Discuss with the Revelers and maybe Aicha about how they could integrate into Marid society
    1. Is Carcy the only Reveler with experience moving to a new country where her species is a small minority?
    2. Integration ideas from Elinore:
        1. Mu could farm
        2. Sarnos could be muscle for monster hunting
        3. Carcy could help fish, help in the workshop with Mending, and/or could make and trade potions
9. Look for scientists and/or research groups
10. Figure out who in the Citadel could verify that the crew aren't monsters

Sarnos's plans:

- Gather info about Maridian society to send back to Hestia
- Confirm the existence of the limit
- Investigate the Darkened Depths

### 1. Mu and Norvin break off

The night of last session, Carcy asked Mu if she could speak with the coral of the Citadel, and they found out that she can. It's very limited by the polyps' low intelligence, but they can answer questions about things they've perceived in the last day.

Carcy, you take the first watch that night, waiting for Lux to come back to the ship to restock on air. They don't come back for several hours, and Norvin takes over the watch.

The next day (Hali 6941):

Everyone is up early in anticipation of Lux coming back.

Farmer Mu has gone to meet [Charbel](../NPCs/Charbel.md), with Sarnos's approval.

Norvin has taken to doing what small repairs the ship needs and running analyses on new data.

Lux has around one hour of air left. What are Carcy and Sarnos doing?

### 2. Encounter with Lux

Lux has been hiding out in the barn. Their oxygen is getting low.

Give Brandon the opportunity to do something before Lux has to go back to the ship. Maybe interact with Charbel, maybe something else.

Lux comes back to the ship, and whatever happens, happens. Maybe treat as as a short encounter.

### 3. What's next?

The crew could go in any number of directions. I've written for some options in the following unnumbered sections.

Something that should definitely happen is that they bring [Habib](../NPCs/Laminites/Habib.md) over to the ship or the gas generator over to Aicha and Habib's in order for Habib to modify their helmets to work without their suits.

### Traveling through the Citadel

Remember to have increased Shabah activity near currents!

If anyone clocks them as non-Maridians outside, the person will try to get away without provoking them, and they'll report to the Royal Guard, who will dispatch the nearest monster hunters by flashing the pearls in the area where the crew was last seen.

Swimming around, the crew will see that some houses (Aicha's included) have the [Laminite](../NPCs/Laminites.md) emblem (a blue solid circle with a number of tight horizontal lines bending around it, forming the shape of an eye) on small flags outside the front of houses.

### Science at the limit

As you swim (or take the Revelation) upwards, a force that pushes you back down becomes stronger and stronger, until it's nearly impossible to overcome.

^ That's the case for things that are dense enough. For things that are close to the density of water or less than its density, they are pushed back by the Shabah manually (at a higher elevation), which, it's possible to notice, is a bit rougher than the magic force's effect (because it's being done manually by the Shabah).

Things that are less dense than water begin to rise faster somewhat close to the limit, but are still stopped very close to the limit by the Shabah.

Some really good science could see pulses of water pushing the Gliss around. That would require seeing far enough, somehow telling that there's water moving, and not being blinded by the sun.

### Communications back to Hestia

Updates from ground control:

- The Gliss is still holding position (although at some point it might zip off)
- The Revelation is nowhere to be seen
- They're looking into spells that can locate the crew
  - Locate Object and Locate Creature have had no effect
  - Looking for a magician who knows Scrying (which will not work because they're on a different plane)

Updates from Archivists Guild:

- They're looking for any kind of record, even mythical, about either the Gliss or a world made of water

### The Altaarikh Library

(pushed over to [Session 3 notes](./Session3.md))

### Probing the Darkened Depths

(pushed over to [Session 3 notes](./Session3.md))

Session ends whenever seems natural.

## Table Notes

Mu has the local sending stone

From Sarnos to ground control:

> There are underwater dwelling people here call Marids.
Marids say there is a "limit" which as approached pushes down and prevents going up. Will confirm independently.
Have contacted two Marids so far; they seem friendly but say not all will be so; concealing our presence for now.
Marids claim there is only one city, made out of coral and floating in the water.
Marids say monsters come from "the depths" below; magical items as well.

Elinore noticed that the sunlight penetrates lower than she'd think — I NEED TO FIGURE THIS OUT

Carcy also learned that water pressure only affects a balloon when it's not on her

I decided the guardian Shabah stop having effect 2-3 meters away from people

Carcy sends limit science to Archivists Guild

I decided that the Shabah regulate the pressure throughout the Citadel, up to the pearls

I conveniently deactivated Norvin (via magic power thing) when Lux was left otherwise alone on the ship

Red light is the signal for summoning royal guard and monster hunters

Carcy goes to library next

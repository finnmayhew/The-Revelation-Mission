# Session 2

## Prep

### 0. Plans

Norvin's plans (Emmett absent):

- Stay with the ship and do maintenance

Mu's plans (Brooke absent):

- Meet the farmer and explore the farm
  - What kind of animals do they have?
- Generally exploring
- Either go with Norvin or report back to it

Carcy's plans:

(1-3 soon, 4-10 future)

1. Figure out if Mu can communicate with the Citadel itself ✓
2. Take first watch on the Revelation while she writes notes ✓
3. Attempt to team up with Lux
4. Investigate the limit
    1. with balloon and rope
    2. with returning spear
5. Update ground control, get them working on solutions (I can use this as a "hints" system)
6. Update the Archivists Guild
7. Go to the nearest library
    1. Learn about the Marid exploration of Poseidon, for making a backup plan if the Revelers have to leave the Citadel
8. Discuss with the Revelers and maybe Aicha about how they could integrate into Marid society
    1. Is Carcy the only Reveler with experience moving to a new country where her species is a small minority?
    2. Integration ideas from Elinore:
        1. Mu could farm
        2. Sarnos could be muscle for monster hunting
        3. Carcy could help fish, help in the workshop with Mending, and/or could make and trade potions
9. Look for scientists and/or research groups
10. Figure out who in the Citadel could verify that the crew aren't monsters

### 1. Mu and Norvin break off

The night of last session, Carcy asked Mu if she could speak with the coral of the Citadel, and they found out that she can. It's very limited by the polyps' low intelligence, but they can answer questions about things they've perceived in the last day.

Carcy, you take the first watch that night, waiting for Lux to come back to the ship to restock on air. They don't come back for several hours, and Norvin takes over the watch.

The next day (Hali 6941):

Everyone is up early in anticipation of Lux coming back.

Farmer Mu has gone to meet [Charbel](../NPCs/Charbel.md), with Sarnos's approval (CONFIRM WITH ALEX).

Norvin has taken to doing what small repairs the ship needs and running analyses on new data.

Lux has around one hour of air left. What are Carcy and Sarnos doing?

### 2. Encounter with Lux

Lux has been hiding out in the barn. Their oxygen is getting low.

Give Brandon the opportunity to do something before Lux has to go back to the ship. Maybe interact with Charbel, maybe something else.

Lux comes back to the ship, and whatever happens, happens. Maybe treat as as a short encounter.

### 3. What's next?

The crew could go in any number of directions. I've written for some options in the following unnumbered sections.

### Science at the limit

As you swim (or take the Revelation) upwards, a force that pushes you back down becomes stronger and stronger, until it's nearly impossible to overcome.

^ That's the case for things that are dense enough. For things that are close to the density of water or less than its density, they are pushed back by the Shabah manually, which, it's possible to notice, is a bit rougher than the magic force's effect (because it's being done manually by the Shabah).

Things that are less dense than water begin to rise faster somewhat close to the limit, but are still stopped very close to the limit by the Shabah.

All things that are less dense than water rise at the same rate as all other things that are less dense than water, and all things that are more dense than water fall at the same rate as all other things that are more dense than water. HOWEVER, that rate increases with height, due to the magic + gravity forces increasing.

Some really good science could see pulses of water pushing the Gliss around. That would require seeing far enough, somehow telling that there's water moving, and not being blinded by the sun.

### The Altaarikh Library

(write)

(learn about [Almuhbasa](../World/Poseidon/Almuhbasa.md))

# Session 2

## Prep

To do:

- Ask Emmett what they want Norvin to do ... (waiting for response)
- Talk with Brooke to figure out what Mu is doing ... (waiting for response)
- Write session

### Carcy's plans

Soon:

- Figure out if Mu can communicate with the Citadel itself
- Take first watch on the Revelation while she writes notes
- Attempt to team up with Lux

Future:

- Investigate the limit
  - with balloon and rope
  - with returning spear
- Update ground control, get them working on solutions (I can use this as a "hints" system)
- Update the Archivists Guild
- Go to the nearest library
  - Learn about the Marid exploration of Poseidon, for making a backup plan if the Revelers have to leave the Citadel
- Discuss with the Revelers and maybe Aicha about how they could integrate into Marid society
  - Is Carcy the only Reveler with experience moving to a new country where her species is a small minority?
  - Integration ideas from Elinore:
    - Mu could farm
    - Sarnos could be muscle for monster hunting
    - Carcy could help fish, help in the workshop with Mending, and/or could make and trade potions
- Look for scientists and/or research groups
- Figure out who in the Citadel could verify that the crew aren't monsters

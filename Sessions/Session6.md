# Session 6

## Prep

### 1. Meeting with Raqayiqi

Mid-day on Hali 6943, the crew (probably) go to Aicha's house in order to learn where to meet Raqayiqi.

Habib meets them. He seems a little stressed, but directs them to the Biwawhatan campus on the side of the Citadel, where Raqayiqi will be cleaning up from a Laminites meeting didn't attend. No need to play this interaction with Habib in a scene unless I think of a reason in the moment.

Biwawhatan is a large, wide, vertical series of block buildings connected to each other by a network of bridges that arc out towards the open ocean before coming back to the surface of the Citadel to meet the entrances to other buildings.

The building Habib directed them towards is a short cylinder. There's a ramp leading down to a door on the lower level, which is propped open with a middle-school chair.

Entering, they find themselves inside a small auditorium; a square stage surrounded by three slanted blocks of seating.

On the side of the stage is a table with a number of dark leaf packets of something, maybe food. Right when you walk in, a Marid man walks out from the stage's closed curtain and heads to the table to put away the packets.

The first thing they'll have to do is figure out how to not spook Raqayiqi.

Then, they can talk with him. He'll tell them what he remembers about the Challenge, if he believes that the crew is going to ask the Padishah to stop the currents. But he has a word of caution: he also went to get advice from the last person who took on the Challenge, and it was pretty different from how he described it (his father succeeded in the Challenge and asked the Padishah for subsidies for farmers while recovering from the Wakes, which she provided). So it could be that the Challenge is changed periodically.

His father remembers the Challenge as a battle gauntlet. For him, the challenge was a seemingly endless maze within the coral.

### 2. Early Morning of Hali 6944

Sending stone messages:

Nothing from the Archivists Guild, but Carcy could send a question.

From ground control:

> Scrying: small dark blue room, opening in back to bright area, cannot see past doorway. Padishah swimming in place, alone, motioning over pink sphere. Over.

Aicha comes out to check on them (if they're somewhere where she can find them). She wishes them the best, and says that she believes they'll make the right call when the time comes for it. She also gives them her pink topaz rock, for two reasons. One, it's a reminder to gain understanding with those whose first instincts may be violent. Two, if they have a large quantity of pink topaz dust, maybe they can use it for some magic, or just use it for general bashing if it comes down to that.

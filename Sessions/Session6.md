# Session 6

## Prep

### 1. Meeting with Raqayiqi

Mid-day on Hali 6943, the crew (probably) go to Aicha's house in order to learn where to meet Raqayiqi.

Habib meets them. He seems a little stressed, but directs them to the Biwawhatan campus on the side of the Citadel, where Raqayiqi will be cleaning up from a Laminites meeting didn't attend. No need to play this interaction with Habib in a scene unless I think of a reason in the moment.

Biwawhatan is a large, wide, vertical series of block buildings connected to each other by a network of bridges that arc out towards the open ocean before coming back to the surface of the Citadel to meet the entrances to other buildings.

The building Habib directed them towards is a short cylinder. There's a ramp leading down to a door on the lower level, which is propped open with a middle-school chair.

Entering, they find themselves inside a small auditorium; a square stage surrounded by three slanted blocks of seating.

On the side of the stage is a table with a number of dark leaf packets of something, maybe food. Right when you walk in, a Marid man walks out from the stage's closed curtain and heads to the table to put away the packets.

The first thing they'll have to do is figure out how to not spook Raqayiqi.

Then, they can talk with him. He'll tell them what he remembers about the Challenge, if he believes that the crew is going to ask the Padishah to stop the currents. But he has a word of caution: he also went to get advice from the last person who took on the Challenge, and it was pretty different from how he described it (his father, Omar, succeeded in the Challenge and asked the Padishah for subsidies for farmers while recovering from the Wakes, which she provided). So it could be that the Challenge is changed periodically.

His father remembers the Challenge as a battle gauntlet. For him, the challenge was a seemingly endless maze within the coral.

### 2. Early Morning of Hali 6944

Sending stone messages:

Nothing from the Archivists Guild, but Carcy could send a question.

From ground control:

> Scrying: small dark blue room, opening in back to bright area, cannot see past doorway. Padishah swimming in place, alone, motioning over pink sphere. Over.

Aicha comes out to check on them (if they're somewhere where she can find them). She wishes them the best, and says that she believes they'll make the right call when the time comes for it. She also gives them her pink topaz rock, for two reasons. One, it's a reminder to gain understanding with those whose first instincts may be violent. Two, if they have a large quantity of pink topaz dust, maybe they can use it for some magic, or just use it for general bashing if it comes down to that.

### 3. The Start of the Challenge

Sarnos and Norvin are going to hang back and watch the first trial from a distance, just in case the crew is suspected to be monsters and are in need of rescue.

They take the currents to the very top of the Citadel, and there's a kind of roundabout-style off-ramp that curves in a large radius around the entrance to the palace. They use it to exit the currents and swim down to the building.

The entrance to the palace is a series of interlocking single-fiber arches at different angles and heights that connect in a single large hexagon at their bases, which acts as a clear delineator of where the Challenge starts. Inside the hexagon, the ground is smooth, white sand, that seems to be packed down, and at the center the sand slopes up to form a 10-feet-wide volcano-looking circular opening to the palace below. The opening is covered by three tight, long nets, which are attached to the base of the arches. Each net has an AC of 10 and takes 10 hit points to break.

There are three Marid royal guards (Miriam, Eleni, and Kostas, see collective character sheet) wearing golden ringed armor sitting on the sloped surface leading up to the opening. They seem to be chatting.

The difficulty here is not necessarily knocking the guards out, but having the guards not realize that they're aliens. If the guards see their helmets, they'll ask about them, but they'll have to roll `Investigation DC 10` to see through them. If they see the party using magic, that's also a good sign that something's up. If they notice, they'll think they're monsters and will try to rush to a certain spot on the perimeter of the hexagon to light the alarm beacon, then they'll try extra hard to prevent the party from entering the palace.

When the party approaches the hexagon, the guards get up and swim over to towards them casually. They'll ask if they're here for the Challenge. They'll explain that passing them acts as a first stage, and that things will get very tough inside the palace. There's also royal guards whose job it is to patrol the Challenge section of the palace and rescue anyone trapped, but they only patrol every few days.

Then they fight. [II Player view](https://www.improved-initiative.com/p/r8fp0jju)

The guards can each cast Fog Cloud with a 20-ft radius once, which is not magic, but uses a large leaf to stir up the sand and obscure the area (the sand will coat the helmets of the PCs, causing them to be `Blinded`, until they take an action to remove it). Then they'll swim to the outside and take kelp vines from the arches and try to wrap up the party (the arches are lined up so that they'd end up wrapped up not at the center). That takes one action, and makes whoever is ensnared `Restrained`, which can be broken out of with a `Strength Check DC 15` or a relevant spell.

End the session when either the party is all knocked out, decided to be monsters, or all enter the palace.

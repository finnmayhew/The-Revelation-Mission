### 1. The Challenge Continues

![The Challenge](../World/Images/The%20Challenge.jpg)

Moving backwards through the "airlock" door as it's shifting, the current suddenly stops, and then reverses direction, moving strongly. After a few turns, the passage arcs downward, then opens into a smaller hemispherical room, about 15 ft in diameter — except the flat part of the hemisphere — covered with a similar black kelp — is at the top of the room, and the curved surfaces is along the bottom. Illuminating the room is a blue stone ring of light with a diameter of 10 ft, and in relief around the surface of the ring are three shapes — a starfish, a seahorse, and a jellyfish. The hole of the ring leads down through to another passageway, which the party is sucked through immediately — meaning that they don't get a good luck at the ring of light unless they find a way to stop themselves. The passageway twists and turns and becomes more horizontal, then opens up back into the main room, with the coral building back behind the party.

After they get all three sea creatures from the trials and place them along the ring, the passageway below will turn to the same glowing blue stone as the ring and suck them down it. This one dumps them into a dark, grey stone hallway, which surprisingly, is filled with air. There's a few puddles around where they land, but it otherwise seems dry, and the water is held in place above them somehow. The hallway slowly curves upward vertically (which they should figure out how to scale), and ends in a shimmering ceiling, which is the reverse-moonpool leading into the Reception Hall.

#### Third Trial

The entrance to the third trial seems to be blocked. The PCs have to cut through the coral to get through, and on the other side they find, strangely, a bedroom. It doesn't look like a Hestian bedroom, or like the design of the interior of Aicha and Habib's house. There's a Maridian man in his 20s sleeping in the bed, and if they look through the windows of the room, they'll find the dark ocean.

Outside this house, they'll find a [Mirage Arcane](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Mirage%20Arcane#content)'s recreation of Almuhbasa. The layout of the city is like Ted Chiang's Tower of Babel — large slopes spiralling around the outside and buildings on the inside of an enormous, slightly swaying coral long coral branch reaching from down in the Darkened Depths.

Totally improvise any encounters they may have in the city. It'll seem real — although since they've never been to Almuhbasa, they don't have much to compare it against. I expect they won't stay here long, since they're focused on the Challenge.

After being shocked at the appearance of the party (both the fact that they appear and how unfamiliar they look, being aliens), the man introduces himself as Omar. He says he lives on Almuhbasa, and two days ago while visiting the Citadel, he decided to take on the Challenge just to see if he could (have him present with the same stats as the guards from the entrance trial). This was the first trial he took on after entering the Challenge, and it seems the trial played with his mind and successfully convinced him that he had never come to the Citadel and that he was back home.

Omar identifies himself as a natural philosopher. He's studying the nature of the sun, and came to the Citadel to see if he could observe it from another angle. He was surprised to find that the sun remained directly overhead at the Citadel.

(In reality, Omar is a projection of the Padishah Kalbari (some spell?), as is everyone on the fake Almuhbasa. She's taken on this persona to gather information about the party after learning that there was something suspicious going on around the Citadel — maybe someone spotted the Revelation landing once. She prompts the party with this knowledge to see if they've figured out the true shape of Poseidon, and she figures that letting that bit of knowledge slip would be fine, because she can just capture them if she wants once they make it through the trial. Her main motivation at this point is curiosity.)

Improvise Omar's involvement in the rest of the Challenge. When either the players run out of options or discover Omar's deception, Omar will smile, say something like "see you soon", and kind of resolve into Vecna-like snaking coral, which will fall away, revealing a seahorse in Omar's place.

The third trial uses the same passageway for its entrance and exit.

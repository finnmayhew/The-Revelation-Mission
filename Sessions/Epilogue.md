# Epilogue

## Prep

### 1. Six Years Later

Six Hestian years have passed.

On Poseidon, Lux and Mu have become friends and have been living on Charbel's farm. After learning concretely that the Padishah has only her own interests in mind and is intent on continuing the Currents to maintain her own power despite the devastation it causes her people, the Laminites have secretly redirected their efforts to spreading this information and turning the Maridians against their leader. Given that the Wake happened despite the public's knowledge of the Stormrider's Pearl, the Laminites have made quick progress, and there is a militia of Maridians ready to help when the time comes.

Lux has been through an epic anime training arc and has leveled up to 20, in order to properly take on the Padishah themself.

Mu has begun her underwater cow farm, which has been surprisingly successful. Charbel and Habib, with the help of Lux's magic, have created an air-filled watertight barn that Mu has been using. It's not open fields, but it's a start. She's also been breeding salamanders.

Shortly after the crew escaped the world, the Padishah instructed a Royal Guard ship to carry out the task she had originally given the Revelation crew, and there is now a current leading from Poseidon's sun to the Darkened Depths. On Hestia, there have been reports of children born without any potential for magical abilities. The cause is known to some of the public, and they're eager for action.

Hestia's plan of attack is to provide Lux with whatever materials they need, through an avenue they expect the Padishah to not have her eye on — the Darkened Depths. The engineers responsible for the Revelation mission have modified the ship mechanically and magically to make it a proper submarine, with the power of such extreme speed that it can zip through the Darkened Depths and bypass the monsters that otherwise prey on those who enter their realm.

The conversion of the Revelation into a submarine was lead by Norvin. Sarnos and Carcy have also been instrumental in the Revelation's refit, as well as in the planning of phase two. When the time is right, the three of them will take the Revelation through the Darkened Depths and deliver whatever supplies Lux needs, and stand by as potential backup during the fight.

Carcy volunteered to test the Revelation's new capabilities during its development, and she's traveled alone a few times to and from Poseidon, without any major incident (at least, not major enough that she or the ship was lost). While on Poseidon, she's visited Almuhbassa and continued her studies with the Shabah. It was Carcy who brought the news that the Shabah were no longer able to counter the Padishah's movement of the Gliss. She's also been developing a physical theory on how the Gliss and Poseidon's sun are physically connected, as well as how they influence ambient magic.

### 2. Lux Fights the Padishah

Lux has reached their final form, which means it's time for phase two of the Revelation mission. Carcy and Sarnos travel to Poseidon and, as usual, hide the Revelation in Charbel's kelp fields. What do they bring to Lux?

To keep the Padishah from seeing this through Scrying, Norvin has been doing increasingly strange acts to ensure that the Padishah uses all her Scrying-level spell slots to watch it instead of the rest of the crew. Ground control's Scrying guy has been checking that this is really the case. The Padishah probably knows that they're planning something, but not exactly what or when it will happen.

I'll skip the NPC interactions to give as much time as possible for the fight.

Where is everyone stationed? Are they making use of the Laminite militia?

First, Lux has to enter the center of the Palace. I assume they don't go through the Challenge again — how do they get in?

Upon getting there, they find the same throne room the crew encountered before. The Padishah is sitting on the throne, but there are no red lines connecting her and the coral.

In the Padishah's mind, she won, and phase two of the Revelation mission is just a hail mary.

If/when she sees Lux, she's say something like, "So, you're back to once again to see that you have no influence in this world?"

Then they fight. [Player view](https://www.improved-initiative.com/p/t42xh8t7)

No particular strategy for the Padishah, just go all out. She'll consider herself fine as long as the captured Shabah isn't destroyed. When she's about to be taken out, she'll Dominate Monster to compel the captured Shabah to obey her, then Dimension Door to a hidden spot in the depths of the Palace and wait to regenerate.

# Session 5

## Prep

### 1. Making the Plan

The night of Hali 6942, after bringing the Itisal back to dock, Carcy returns to the ship. Does she bring Aicha?

Norvin is doing repairs to the ship post-encounter at the Darkened Depths.

Also, is the ship still floating far from the Citadel, or did they go back to Charbel's kelp farm?

Mu has a pile of things to fix.

This part of the session will be mostly talking in character, trying to figure out the way forward now that they've been given a mission by the Shabah. If Lux has the slot, they can cast Tongues again and bring their guardian Shabah into the conversation.

If Aicha is there, here are her thoughts:

- Excited that they made contact with the Shabah
- Did they say anything about whether removing the currents would be bad for them? (They said it wouldn't be)
- It is a really bad idea to try to do something that might harm the Padishah
- If they're set on doing that, she's not going to directly turn them in to the government, but she will let Charbel know what their plans are the next day
  - Charbel will then kick them out of his farm if they're still there

### 2. The Morning of Hali 6943

First of all, ground control had asked the party to document Lux's spells and abilities. Have they done that? (or did they do that last session and I forgot?)

Sending stone messages for the day:

From Archivists Guild:

> Found old record of strange turbulence near bottom of ocean, not as regular as limit punches you describe. Could not find more info on Lux.

From ground control:

> Will begin scrying in five minutes. Prepare what you have to report, and we'll respond on Sending Stones. Over.

Then they'll have the Scrying session.

If they tell ground control their plan, they'll encourage them to use whatever means they have of getting home, but they'll also encourage them to be cautious.

After Scrying:

If Aicha told Charbel about their plan and they're still there, he'll come over the Revelation's viewscreen and let them know that if they're still in his farm by the end of the day, he's going to alert the government about them. He also encourages them to not do anything that would fuck up the order of the colony.

### X. The Start of the Challenge

If they decide to take on the Challenge:

They take the currents to the very top of the Citadel, and there's a kind of roundabout-style off-ramp that curves in a large radius around the entrance to the palace. They use it to exit the currents and swim down to the building.

The entrance to the palace is a series of interlocking single-fiber arches at different angles and heights that connect in a single large hexagon at their bases, which acts as a clear delineator of where the Challenge starts. Inside the hexagon, the ground is smooth, white sand, that seems to be packed down, and at the center the sand slopes up to form a 10-feet-wide volcano-looking circular opening to the palace below.

There are three Marid royal guards (Miriam, Eleni, and Kostas, see collective character sheet) wearing golden ringed armor sitting on the sloped surface leading up to the opening. They seem to be chatting.

The difficulty here is not necessarily knocking the guards out, but having the guards not realize that they're aliens. If the guards see their helmets, they'll ask about them, but they'll have to roll `Investigation DC 10` to see through them. If they see the party using magic, that's also a good sign that something's up. If they notice, they'll think they're monsters and will try to rush to a certain spot on the perimeter of the hexagon to light the alarm beacon, then they'll try extra hard to prevent the party from entering the palace.

When the party approaches the hexagon, the guards get up and swim over to towards them casually. They'll ask if they're here for the Challenge. They'll explain that passing them acts as a first stage, and that things will get very tough inside the palace. There's also royal guards whose job it is to patrol the Challenge section of the palace and rescue anyone trapped, but they only patrol every few days.

Then they fight. Improved Initiative player view [here](https://www.improved-initiative.com/p/e3rh5kas).

The guards can each cast Fog Cloud with a 20-ft radius once, which is not magic, but uses a large leaf to stir up the sand and obscure the area. Then they'll swim to the outside and take kelp vines from the arches and try to wrap up the party (the arches are lined up so that they'd end up wrapped up not at the center). That takes one action, and makes whoever is ensnared `Restrained`, which can be broken out of with a `Strength Check DC 15` or a relevant spell.

End the session when either the party is all knocked out, decided to be monsters, or all enter the palace.

## Table Notes

Ground control don't know that Lux has Tiny Hut

Aicha is not telling Charbel at the moment, since they didn't say the plan was to attack the Padishah

From ground control during scrying:

> Will discuss Shabah info. Use whatever means possible to come home, but also be cautious. Over.

Crew asked if they could Scry the Padishah.

> Cannot send another cow :(. Will attempt to scry the Padishah tomorrow. Over.

SET UP PADISHAH SCRYING

Shabah will not tell Aicha if they're planning on harming the Padishah

Lux's Shabah said that they should go to the maze today

Lux's Shabah's least favorite color is green

The Shabah have never gone through the entire Darkened Depths

Lux: "Can I help you kill the Padishah and take their place"

Shabah: "Yes"

Shabah are sometimes harmed by monsters (like with destroy water magic)

The Shabah know that the Padishah is moving the Gliss, but not why — although they know that they have to fix it themselves to allow the Hestians to get magic, which they want just to help the Hestians — and they don't know where the Gliss is

Lux's Shabah attaches itself to people for fun

They may go to find the Laminites before doing the Challenge

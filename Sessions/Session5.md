# Session 5

## Prep

### 1. Making the Plan

The night of Hali 6942, after bringing the Itisal back to dock, Carcy returns to the ship. Does she bring Aicha?

Norvin is doing repairs to the ship post-encounter at the Darkened Depths.

Also, is the ship still floating far from the Citadel, or did they go back to Charbel's kelp farm?

Mu has a pile of things to fix.

This part of the session will be mostly talking in character, trying to figure out the way forward now that they've been given a mission by the Shabah. If Lux has the slot, they can cast Tongues again and bring their guardian Shabah into the conversation.

If Aicha is there, here are her thoughts:

- Excited that they made contact with the Shabah
- Did they say anything about whether removing the currents would be bad for them? (They said it wouldn't be)
- It is a really bad idea to try to do something that might harm the Padishah
- If they're set on doing that, she's not going to directly turn them in to the government, but she will let Charbel know what their plans are the next day
  - Charbel will then kick them out of his farm if they're still there

### 2. The Morning of Hali 6943

First of all, ground control had asked the party to document Lux's spells and abilities. Have they done that? (or did they do that last session and I forgot?)

Sending stone messages for the day:

From Archivists Guild:

> Found old record of strange turbulence near bottom of ocean, not as regular as limit punches you describe. Could not find more info on Lux.

From ground control:

> Will begin scrying in five minutes. Prepare what you have to report, and we'll respond on Sending Stones. Over.

Then they'll have the Scrying session.

If they tell ground control their plan, they'll encourage them to use whatever means they have of getting home, but they'll also encourage them to be cautious.

After Scrying:

If Aicha told Charbel about their plan and they're still there, he'll come over the Revelation's viewscreen and let them know that if they're still in his farm by the end of the day, he's going to alert the government about them. He also encourages them to not do anything that would fuck up the order of the colony.

## Table Notes

Ground control don't know that Lux has Tiny Hut

Aicha is not telling Charbel at the moment, since they didn't say the plan was to attack the Padishah

From ground control during scrying:

> Will discuss Shabah info. Use whatever means possible to come home, but also be cautious. Over.

Crew asked if they could Scry the Padishah.

> Cannot send another cow :(. Will attempt to scry the Padishah tomorrow. Over.

SET UP PADISHAH SCRYING

Shabah will not tell Aicha if they're planning on harming the Padishah

Lux's Shabah said that they should go to the maze today

Lux's Shabah's least favorite color is green

The Shabah have never gone through the entire Darkened Depths

Lux: "Can I help you kill the Padishah and take their place"

Shabah: "Yes"

Shabah are sometimes harmed by monsters (like with destroy water magic)

The Shabah know that the Padishah is moving the Gliss, but not why — although they know that they have to fix it themselves to allow the Hestians to get magic, which they want just to help the Hestians — and they don't know where the Gliss is

Lux's Shabah attaches itself to people for fun

They may go to find the Laminites before doing the Challenge

## Hidden cosmology

[Hestia](World/Hestia.md) and [Poseidon](World/Poseidon.md) are the exterior and interior surfaces (respectively) of a spherical shell.

[The Gliss](World/Gliss.md) and Poseidon's "sun" are two sides of the same object, and you can pass "into" the Gliss and come "out of" Poseidon's sun, like a black whole and a white hole. Poseidon's sun acts as a source of the Weave and the Gliss acts as a sink of the Weave. The Weave is a vector field similar to the electromagnetic field that imparts a force onto objects, and its corresponding scalar potential is a "magic potential" (maybe the party will name this something else). The Gliss and Poseidon's sun are situated such that they act as a magic charge / image charge pair that create an equi-magic-potential surface at the surface of the planet (to figure out: what does this acheive?). Poseidon's sun is not at the center of the whole structure (otherwise the Gliss would be at infinity to be the image of Poseidon's sun). When Poseidon's sun moves for whatever reason, the Gliss moves to be its image and preserve the equi-magic-potential surface.

## Mysteries for the party to solve

- What is the Gliss?
- How do they get home?
  - How did they get to Poseidon?
  - Where is are Poseidon and Hestia in relation to each other?
- What's up with Poseidon's sky and sun?

## Planned arc

1. Land on Poseidon (Session Zero or 1)
2. Get acquainted with [the Overworld](World/Poseidon.md#the-overworld)
3. Discover that Hestia is "below" Poseidon
4. Venture into and through [the Underdark](World/Poseidon.md#the-underdark)
5. Return to Hestia

Questions and thoughts:

- How can they discover how Hestia and Poseidon relate?
  - Probably a number of ways, this is the main physics puzzle
- How do the Overworld and Underdark relate?
  - Consequentially, how could the party interface with them in order to get back to Hestia?
- What's the thematic importance of the existence of the Gliss, Poseidon's sun, and the equi-magic-potential surface?
  - Maybe it's just a physics discovery, and that holds intrinsic importance from the perspective of the characters and players

# Sending Stones

## Hali 6940

From ground control:

> Gliss is holding position. No issues with liftoff on our end. Report? Over.

Captain's stone:

> URGENT: There is a Changeling aboard masquerading as First Officer Ollim. You are ordered to restrain them. Copy? Over.

## Hali 6941

From ground control:

- The Gliss is still holding position (although at some point it might zip off)
- The Revelation is nowhere to be seen
- They're looking into spells that can locate the crew
  - Locate Object and Locate Creature have had no effect
  - Looking for a magician who knows Scrying (which will not work because they're on a different plane)

To ground control:

> There are underwater dwelling people here call Marids.
Marids say there is a "limit" which as approached pushes down and prevents going up. Will confirm independently.
Have contacted two Marids so far; they seem friendly but say not all will be so; concealing our presence for now.
Marids claim there is only one city, made out of coral and floating in the water.
Marids say monsters come from "the depths" below; magical items as well.

From Archivists Guild:

- They're looking for any kind of record, even mythical, about either the Gliss or a world made of water

To Archivists Guild:

> Gravity increases with height. Subaqueously dense objects stop, feeling continuous “punches” downward, 30' higher than aqueously dense objects. Water pressure unchanging near creatures, normal elsewhere.

## Hali 6942

From Archivists Guild:

> Can't find any mythical record of a water world. Re: physics at the limit, we're finding magicians and scientists of historically water-based kingdoms for consultation.

Carcy to Archivists Guild:

> Lux: age? history? personality?

From ground control:

> Gliss has moved far away. Hired an advanced magician capable of scrying. When one of you senses a presence, do not resist observation. Report? Over.

(after hearing the Shabah during scrying, and hearing about the attack at the Darkened Depths)

> Noted. Is the ship's structural integrity holding? We can hear a knocking sound from the hull. Over.

(after they respond, likely verbally)

> We'll work on all this. If possible, document the imposter's spells and capabilities and display or describe to us for future problem solving. Over.

## Hali 6943

From Archivists Guild:

> Found old record of strange turbulence near bottom of ocean, not as regular as limit punches you describe. Could not find more info on Lux.

From ground control:

> Will begin scrying in five minutes. Prepare what you have to report, and we'll respond on Sending Stones. Over.
>
> Will discuss Shabah info. Use whatever means possible to come home, but also be cautious. Over.
>
> Cannot send another cow :(. Will attempt to scry the Padishah tomorrow. Over.

## Hali 6944

From ground control:

> Scrying: Scrying: small dark blue room, opening in back to bright area, cannot see past doorway. Padishah swimming in place, alone, motioning over pink sphere. Over.

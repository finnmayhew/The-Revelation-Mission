# To Do

- [ ] Why does Poseidon have a 24-hour cycle?
- [ ] What causes the wakes? Could they start early?
- [ ] Name Aicha's magic rock
- [ ] Possibilities for next session or near future:
  - [ ] An omen of the wake starts, and Habib (or someone else) takes on the trial
  - [ ] Lux contacts the Shabah
  - [ ] People who are suspicious of Carcy find her again and see more suspicious things and track her, revealing the location of the ship
  - [ ] Norvin wakes up with a sense that the magic level is off â€” or that their energy is too high, and with the insight that their energy comes from magic

## Backburner

- [ ] Render scientists and/or research groups (Almuhbasa)
- [ ] Build the journey to the center of the Citadel
- [ ] Build the Underdark

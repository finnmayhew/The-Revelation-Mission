# The Shabah

A species who live on [Poseidon](../World/Poseidon.md) in parallel with the Marids in the [Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls](../World/Poseidon/Citadel.md) (see their [section](../World/Poseidon/Citadel.md#the-shabah) in the Citadel file).

Because of their biological difference with most other life (being made entirely of water), their intentions are unknown to all other life.

The Shabah life in near harmony with the planet, in an almost utopian society ("almost" because "utopian" is subjective). They live in the Citadel (including the interior) and pursue whatever interests they have, although those interests look very different than the Maridian jobs. They do not communicate verbally, instead sensing others intentions through sight context.

They have an intuitive understanding of physical reality, and they are the ones who move [Poseidon's sun](../World/Gliss.md) to match the Gliss, such that the Hestians can develop magic.

They have a basic understanding of Marid society, but not much interest in it. This would change if they were to learn about the Stormrider's Pearl and its implications for their life in the Citadel.

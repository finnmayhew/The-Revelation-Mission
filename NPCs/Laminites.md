# The Laminites

A prominent political group in the [Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls](../World/Poseidon/Citadel.md).

They hold the position that the Stormrider's Pearl should be used to completely control the Currents. With the Wake due in about two months, they're eager to ensure that the [Padishah](./Kalbari.md) uses the Stormrider's Pearl to control the currents. Their campaign is based on holding public events and raising awareness — they're not (knowingly) a violent group.

They have vague support, but not enough that anyone has actually undertaken the trial and presented their take on the issue to the Padishah. People in general believe that she'll do it (since it seems like a clearly helpful thing to do), and that's one of the reasons no one has done the trial for that cause besides [Raqayiqi](./Laminites/Raqayiqi.md).

Their emblem is a blue solid circle with a number of tight horizontal lines bending around it, forming the shape of an eye.

Notable members:

- [Raqayiqi](./Laminites/Raqayiqi.md)
- [Aicha](./Laminites/Aicha.md)
- [Habib](./Laminites/Habib.md)

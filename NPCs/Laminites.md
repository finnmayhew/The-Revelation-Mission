# The Laminites

A prominent political group in the [Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls](../World/Poseidon/Citadel.md).

They hold the position that the Stormrider's Pearl should be used to completely control the Currents. With the Wake due in about two months, they're eager to ensure that the [Padishah](./Kalbari.md) uses the Stormrider's Pearl to control the currents. Their campaign is based on holding public events and raising awareness — they're not (knowingly) a violent group.

Their emblem is a blue solid circle with a number of tight horizontal lines bending around it, forming the shape of an eye.

Their leader is [Raqayiqi](./Laminites/Raqayiqi.md).

Notable members:

- [Aicha](./Laminites/Aicha.md)
- [Habib](./Laminites/Habib.md)

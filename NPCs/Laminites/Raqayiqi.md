# Raqayiqi

A Marid.

The leader of the [Laminites](../Laminites.md), and formerly a kelp farmer.

A year ago, he attempted to seek out the [Padishah](../Kalbari.md) to convince her to use the Stormrider's Pearl to control the currents. He was unsuccessful, lost in the maze, and nearly died of starvation before the Royal Guard found him, which permanently harmed his constitution. He founded the Laminites in order to promote the idea of ensuring that the Stormrider's Pearl be used to counter the currents, so that someone else would undertake the trial and promote that goal.

Speaks with a flat, soft, round, almost creepy but not actually creepy voice. Enunciates.

A Marid.

The member of the [Laminites](../Laminites.md)

The wife of [Habib](./Habib.md), who she has two sons with, [Faris and Fahad](../Faris_and_Fahad.md).

The captain of the fishing ship The Itisal.

She found a magical item on a fishing expedition about a year ago — a pink crystal that looks like my salt lamp. After accidentally inhaling a bit of the dust, she's found that she's been able to understand languages she hadn't been able to in the past — but not the Shabah. She's been working on mixing the dust with other substances to see if she can find a mixture that will allow for communication with the Shabah, following a very slight apprehension about the Laminites' plan for the Stormrider's Pearl.

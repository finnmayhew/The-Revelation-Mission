# Charbel

A Marid farmer.

He was the first person to run into [Lux](../PCs/Lux.md), and although they couldn't understand each other's languages, he gave Lux asylum in his barn.

A friend of [Aicha](./Laminites/Aicha.md)'s.

As a farmer, he's a big proponent of the idea of controlling the currents with the Stormrider's Pearl.

Description given to Brooke:

> He has three sections to his farm.
>
> The first is the majority of the kelp, which is easy to maintain and he spends the least of his time on it.
>
> The second is a long, compartmentalized building that he uses to breed small animals like ragworms, lugworms, leeches, crayfish, and lobster, which he sells as bait for fishing expeditions.  This is how he makes most of his money.
>
> The third is his favorite, although he does it more as a hobby than as a specialty.  Charbel explains that most buildings on the Citadel are constructed from these modular blocks of compressed kelp (which is what the first section of his farm is growing for).  But the more expensive buildings are custom-grown kelp in certain guided patterns, like how bonsai trees are sculpted in the real world.  This is a tough process, and it's rare that he produces something sellable, but it's a passion of his.  The buildings that are considered to be of the absolute highest quality are made of a single unbroken sculpted bundle of kelp.

Speaks slowly, softly, with a lot of breath, and with a southern accent.

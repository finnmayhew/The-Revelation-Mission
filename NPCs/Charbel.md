# Charbel

A Marid farmer.

He was the first person to run into [Lux](../PCs/Lux.md), and although they couldn't understand each other's languages, he gave Lux asylum in his barn.

A friend of [Aicha](./Laminites/Aicha.md)'s.

As a farmer, he's a big proponent of the idea of controlling the currents with the Stormrider's Pearl.

While he has a kelp farm, because it's easy to maintain he spends most of his time farming bait that's used on fishing expeditions. That's mostly in a long building that has a number of different compartments, with animals like ragworms, lugworms, leeches, crayfish, and lobster.

Speaks slowly, softly, with a lot of breath, and with a southern accent.
